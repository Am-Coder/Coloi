# Coloi
Image Colorization using deep learning models( implemented in tensorflow ).

Here 3 different models are utilized where the third model gives us highest accuracy in colorizing black and white images. This model makes use of transfer learning (Using inception resnetV2) and an encoder-decoder network.
